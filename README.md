# HerobrinePVP-CORE
A main server core plugin that works with GameCore to have a server that runs some pretty cool minigames. Manages a LOT of things such as user data, permissions, punishments, chat, and a whole lot more. Also just contains a whole lot of useful commands you'd want to have on any server.

The core itself was developed in 2019, and has been updated overtime. It plays key front and back end roles in the GameCore and associated projects.   

Some of the cool things:
- Player Levels:

 - Players can earn XP by playing minigames on the server, and earn rewards through a nice prestige system.
 - Every 10 levels, you reach a new prestige - and each prestige has a coin and XP multiplier, netting you even more rewards for playing!

- Item Unlocks:
 - Unlock chat emotes and in-game classes via the shop for coins earned by playing games on the server!
